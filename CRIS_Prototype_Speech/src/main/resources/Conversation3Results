    "Good morning! Elizabeth speaking. How can I help you?",
    "Hello! I have a problem with my internet connection.",
    "Is the problem related to the phone number you’re calling me from?",
    "No, it’s not. The problem is on my Vodafone router. The one that has a SIM card in it.",
    "A Vodafone Sim card. Do you know the number for that card?",
    "No, I don't.",
    "Will I find the number on the same account that your current phone number is registered to? Or is it a rechargeable SIM card?",
    "Honestly I don’t know. The number is registered to a company. I can give you all the information related to that company, if it helps you.",
    "The company’s registration number, please.",
    "It’s R-O-1-2.",
    "1-2.",

    "Automotive Repairs International.",
    "I see! Mister Jack, are you the administrator of that company?",
    "Yes, I am.",
    "OK then! I see that multiple internet subscriptions are registered on this account. They all appear to be terminated. Did you make any requests for closing these subscriptions? They are all closed right now, it appears.",
    "I think so. This is the problem, then?",
    "Most likely.",
    "I haven’t received, I really don’t know, any confirmation for closing them or any notification as to when they are supposed to be terminated.",
    "Haven’t you been notified by your accountant specialist?",
    "I can’t remember.",

    "It appears as such! Did you request cancelation for all the phone numbers associated with your account or just for a single one?",
    "I need to check my e-mail to see exactly what happened.",
    "Here it says that you’ve made your request on the 4th day of February. Most likely, after 30 days your subscription was terminated. That’s the way our policy handles such requests. After 30 days have passed the corresponding subscription is canceled automatically. Right now, your subscriptions show as terminated and every number associated with them.",
    "Yeah.",
