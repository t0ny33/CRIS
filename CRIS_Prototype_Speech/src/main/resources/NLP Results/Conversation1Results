    "Hello! Good day! I’m Thomas Jackson. I’m from Los Angeles, California. Sorry to bother you! I’ve just talked with one of your colleagues who has already told me how to set up my access points names. How to activate my mobile data service. But nothing works, changing the settings does nothing to make it work. My phone is a HTC One, registered on this phone number, but nothing, nothing works. I’ve done everything in the settings menu, I did everything that I was told. I did it a thousand times but it still doesn’t work.",
    "For how long have you been encountering this issue?",
    "Say again.",
    "For how long has this issue been happening?",
    "Ever since I’ve bought my phone.",
    "Is it a new phone?",
    "Yes.",
    "I’m glad to hear that it’s a new phone! Alright, I’ll help you with your problem. Would you kindly go again to the settings menu screen for me?",
    "Just a bit.",
    "Is it Dual-SIM?",
    "One second. Right. At the Access Point Names option?",
    "Yes, Access Point Names.",
    "I see a plus sign.",
    "Yes. Press it and start editing a new APN entry.",
    "Name?",
    "Internet. Type it in lowercase.",
    "Yeah. OK.",
    "OK.",
    "What about APN?",
    "Live dot Vodafone dot com. Again, only with lowercase letters.",
    "One second, just a bit.",
    "Again, it’s live dot Vodafone dot com.",
    "That’s it. Done!",
    "Press “OK” so that it stays saved. What comes after APN? APN type or proxy?",
    "All right! I pressed OK. Proxy. Port. I’m trying to tell you that, just one second. That I have my menu language set to Italian. I’m trying to tell you how it would sound like in English. It says proxy, port, username.",
    "It’s live, L-I-V-E, again in lowercase.",
    "Is it LIVE or LINE?",
    "LIVE, L-I-V-E.",
    "OK! All done!",
    "The password is Vodafone, all with lowercase letters.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And after you’ve set the password to Vodafone, you’ll see right below it authentication type. It’s another option.",
    "Authentication type.",
    "Right there. Make sure PAP is selected. That’s P-A-P.",
    "OK!",
    "And for APN type, please type in default. That’s default, all in lowercase.",
    "Ok. I did it.",
    "That would be all. Now make sure you save the APN by clicking those 3 dots, in the upper-right part of the screen.",
    "Ok. I’ve saved it.",
    "After you’ve saved it, it’s important that it stays selected. Keep in mind that we’ve named it “internet”.",
    "Yes. It has been selected.",
    "That’s perfect! From what I’ve checked so far I see that you have option 6 activated on your account. I remind you that offer 6 has 50 GB of mobile data traffic, valid for 28 days. That means it’s active until the 4th of the following month. If you consider upgrading, to increase the valid period on your offer from 28 days to 5 weeks, you can opt for offer 7. Offer 7 has the same benefits as offer 6, but with an increase in the number of days it remains valid. OK, back to our problem. After we’ve finished talking shut down you phone, turn it on again, and check if your mobile data service is enabled and functional. I’ll call you back to check if everything is all right. Ok then.",
    "Good, so now I turn it off and I’ll call you back to.",
    "No, I’ll call you to check if everything is OK.",
    "OK then. It will only take a couple of minutes.",
    "All right! I’ll call you back in 5 minutes, max.",

Text: That’s perfect! From what I’ve checked so far I see that you have option 6 activated on your account. I remind you that offer 6 has 50 GB of mobile data traffic, valid for 28 days. That means it’s active until the 4th of the following month. If you consider upgrading, to increase the valid period on your offer from 28 days to 5 weeks, you can opt for offer 7. Offer 7 has the same benefits as offer 6, but with an increase in the number of days it remains valid. OK, back to our problem. After we’ve finished talking shut down you phone, turn it on again, and check if your mobile data service is enabled and functional. I’ll call you back to check if everything is all right. Ok then.
